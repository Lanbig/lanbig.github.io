My name is Rungtham Rodrawangpai. People called me "Ben". Currently, Iâ€™m a grad student at DePaul University. My major is Predictive Analytics (aka. Data Science), which emphasizes technical proficiency and practical experience with advanced skills in data mining, multivariate statistics, machine learning, and database processing.
