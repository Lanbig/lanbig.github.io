## Sale Trends

![Sale Trends Heat Map](https://github.com/Lanbig/CSC465-Project/raw/master/CalendarHeat-Sales.png)

A calendar heat map is a graphical representation that can visualize values over days in a calendar. Moreover, using this heat map allowed us to see the overall pattern in the data set. In this graph, our group used red color to represent the days that had a high sales value, and used blue to represent the days that had a low sales value. 

Weekly pattern of sales value
* Customers usually go shopping on the weekend.

Daily pattern of sales value
* The customers spent more money on some special days. For example, the customers spent a lot of money at this grocery store on the days before Thanksgiving and Christmas Day. 

Ideas for further exploration
* Sales could be plotted against the volume of items sold to see if some days sell more expensive products
