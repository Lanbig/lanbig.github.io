In this example, we are going to forecast the volatility of Microsoft stock. First, we will attempt to discover dataset. Our data set consists of closing prices of MSFT from January 2, 1998 to February 26, 2016. The number of observations is equal to 4,567 closing prices. Our data was retrieved from the Yahoo! Finance website under historical data. Here is plot of the time series

## Let's start with exploratory analysis of the data

```R 
library(rugarch)
library(ggplot2)
library(zoo)
library(fBasics)
library(fUnitRoots)

myd= read.table('MSFT.csv', header=T, sep=',')
myd_lim = myd[1:4567,]
pricets = zoo(myd_lim$Adj.Close, as.Date(as.character(myd_lim$Date),format=c("%Y-%m-%d")))

autoplot(pricets)

```
![MSFT Time Series](http://{{ site.url }}/img/content_images/timeseries.png)

Originally, we took the data set from the IPO (Initial Public Offering) date of March 13, 1986. However, there was too much of trend since the stock has split many times. With this in mind, we decided to start to our data set in February of 1998. As you can see there is a steep run up during the dot com bubble of the late 1990â€™s and early 2000. The tech bubble peaked on March 10, 2000. Next there was a steep drop, and then the stock hung around 20 for years. Then during the Mortgage crisis the stock dropped down into the teens, bottoming in 2009. Since the company made Satya Nadella the CEO, the stock has had a nice rally up to the volatility of early 2016.

Next, we going to use acf for checking non-stationary behavior.

```R
acf(coredata(pricets))

```


```R
# the ACF function of the first difference
dx=diff(coredata(pricets)) 
acf(as.vector(dx),lag.max=30, main="ACF of first difference")
adfTest(dx, lags=3, type=c("ct"))
adfTest(dx, lags=5, type=c("ct"))
adfTest(dx, lags=7, type=c("ct"))

rets = log(pricets/lag(pricets, -1))
head(rets)

basicStats(rets)
autoplot(rets)

```
![MSFT Time Series](http://{{ site.url }}/img/content_images/logret.png)

The ACF plot(below) of the squared log returns of MSFT decays very slowly. The lags are all much larger than 2 standard deviations. This confirms large autocorrelations in the squared log returns. Therefore we can conclude that the log returns process has a strong non-linear dependence.

Since we have confirmed serial correlation in the conditional variance of the process, we can say that the conditional variance of the process at time t is a function of the variance at previous times. Therefore we can use the past to explain or predict the current variance. This enables us to use GARCH model to model the variance of the MSFT stock price time series.





## Model Fitting
This enables us to use GARCH model to model the variance of the MSFT stock price time series.
Model fitting
There were 4 models applied to MSFT stock:
* GARCH with normally distributed errors
* GARCH with T distributed errors
* EGARCH with T distributed errors
* TGARCH with T distributed errors

```R
#MODEL 1: AR(0)-GARCH(1,1) with normally distributed errors
garch11.spec=ugarchspec(variance.model=list(garchOrder=c(1,1)),
                        mean.model=list(armaOrder=c(0,0)))
garch11.fit=ugarchfit(spec=garch11.spec, data=rets)
garch11.fit
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(garch11.fit)

#MODEL 2: AR(0)-GARCH(1,1) with T distributed errors
garch11.t.spec=ugarchspec(variance.model=list(garchOrder=c(1,1)),
                            mean.model=list(armaOrder=c(0,0)), distribution.model = "std")

garch11.t.fit=ugarchfit(spec=garch11.t.spec, data=rets)
garch11.t.fit


#MODEL 3: AR(0)-EARCH(1,1) with T distributed errors *** The best one based on BIC
egarch11.t.spec=ugarchspec(variance.model=list(model = "eGARCH",
                                                 garchOrder=c(1,1)), mean.model=list(armaOrder=c(0,0)),
                             distribution.model = "std")
egarch11.t.fit=ugarchfit(spec=egarch11.t.spec, data=rets)
egarch11.t.fit
plot(egarch11.t.fit)

egarch11.t.fcst=ugarchforecast(egarch11.t.fit, n.ahead=12)
egarch11.t.fcst
plot(egarch11.t.fcst)

```
Below was the model we selected because it was the best fit

## Residual analysis and model diagnostics

## Forecast analysis

## Sum up
After running ACF tests and Dickey Fuller tests on the time series and first difference of the time series, we conclude the MSFT stock returns are non-stationary. Our ACF tests on log returns squared along with our failure to reject the null hypothesis of the Box-Ljung Test on the residuals leads us to conclude there is an ARCH Effect. After finding the ARCH Effect we used 4 different GARCH Models to model the volatility. Using the BIC Criteria, Pearson Goodness of Fit, and Residual analysis that our AR(0) EGARCH(1,1) with t-distribution is an adequate fit as a model for the data.
