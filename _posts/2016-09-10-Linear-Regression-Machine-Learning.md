In this part of this exercise, I will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. 
Matlab is the tools I used for this project. **Link to [Github](https://github.com/Lanbig/Machine-Learning/tree/master/machine-learning-ex1)**

### Plotting the data
The first figure shows the scatter plot of profit and population in the city. 
![Scatter plot and linear line](/images/posts/content_images/linear-fit.png)
The scatter plot of the training data reveals the positive relationship between profit and population. Also, the blue line is the regression line.

```matlab
function plotData(x, y)

  plot(x, y, 'rx', 'MarkerSize', 10); % Plot the data 
  ylabel('Profit in $10,000s'); % Set the y?axis label 
  xlabel('Population of City in 10,000s'); % Set the x?axis label

  figure; % open a new figure window

end
```
<br />

### Gradient descent 
In this part, I will fit the linear regression parameters Î¸ to our dataset using gradient descent. The objective of linear regression is to minimize the cost function
```matlab
J = sum((X * theta - y) .^ 2) / (2*m);
```
where the hypothesis h0(x) is given by the linear model

For population = 35,000, we predict a profit of 4519.767868<br />
For population = 70,000, we predict a profit of 45342.450129<br />

```matlab
% Predict values for population sizes of 35,000 and 70,000
predict1 = [1, 3.5] *theta;
predict2 = [1, 7] * theta;
```
<br />
Next, the implementation of gradient descent is in gradientDescent.m

```matlab
function [theta, J_history] = gradientDescent(X, y, theta, alpha, num_iters)

m = length(y); % number of training examples
J_history = zeros(num_iters, 1);

for iter = 1:num_iters
    theta = theta - (alpha/m) * (X' * (X * theta - y));
    J_history(iter) = computeCost(X, y, theta);
end

end
```

Visualizing J(theta_0, theta_1)

#### Surface plot
![Surface plot](/images/posts/content_images/linear-cost-function.png)

#### Contour plot
![Contour plot](/images/posts/content_images/linear-cost-function2.png)

```matlab
fprintf('Visualizing J(theta_0, theta_1) ...\n')

% Grid over which we will calculate J
theta0_vals = linspace(-10, 10, 100);
theta1_vals = linspace(-1, 4, 100);

% initialize J_vals to a matrix of 0's
J_vals = zeros(length(theta0_vals), length(theta1_vals));

% Fill out J_vals
for i = 1:length(theta0_vals)
    for j = 1:length(theta1_vals)
	  t = [theta0_vals(i); theta1_vals(j)];    
	  J_vals(i,j) = computeCost(X, y, t);
    end
end


% Because of the way meshgrids work in the surf command, we need to 
% transpose J_vals before calling surf, or else the axes will be flipped
J_vals = J_vals';
% Surface plot
figure;
surf(theta0_vals, theta1_vals, J_vals)
xlabel('\theta_0'); ylabel('\theta_1');

% Contour plot
figure;
% Plot J_vals as 15 contours spaced logarithmically between 0.01 and 100
contour(theta0_vals, theta1_vals, J_vals, logspace(-2, 3, 20))
xlabel('\theta_0'); ylabel('\theta_1');
hold on;
plot(theta(1), theta(2), 'rx', 'MarkerSize', 10, 'LineWidth', 2);
```
