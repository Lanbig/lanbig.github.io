In this part of this exercise, I will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. 
Matlab is the tools I used for this project. Link to [Github](https://github.com/Lanbig/Machine-Learning/tree/master/machine-learning-ex1)

### Plotting 
The first figure shows the scatter plot of profit and population in the city. 
![Scatter plot and linear line](/images/posts/content_images/linear-fit.png)
The scatter plot of the training data reveals the positive relationship between profit and population. Also, the blue line is the regression line.

```matlab
function plotData(x, y)

  plot(x, y, 'rx', 'MarkerSize', 10); % Plot the data 
  ylabel('Profit in $10,000s'); % Set the y?axis label 
  xlabel('Population of City in 10,000s'); % Set the x?axis label

  figure; % open a new figure window

end
```

<br />
### Gradient descent 
In this part, I will fit the linear regression parameters Î¸ to our dataset using gradient descent. 
```
x^y
```
<br />
For population = 35,000, we predict a profit of 4519.767868<br />
For population = 70,000, we predict a profit of 45342.450129<br />
